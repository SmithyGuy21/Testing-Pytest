# Mode Finder Tester

## Overview

This simple Python project, named "Mode Finder Tester," serves as my initial exploration into GitHub and unit testing. The project includes a basic function, `mode_finder`, and a set of tests to verify its functionality.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single Python script: `mode_finder.py`


- The `mode_finder.py` file contains the main function (`mode_finder`) and its associated test suite (`test_mode_finder`).

## Functionality

The `mode_finder` function is designed to find the mode (most frequently occurring element) in a list of numbers. The associated test suite, `test_mode_finder`, checks various scenarios to ensure the correct behavior of the function.

## Purpose

This project serves as my initial attempt to:
- Familiarize myself with GitHub and version control.
- Understand the basics of unit testing in Python using `pytest`.
- Explore the process of creating a simple testing script.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Run Tests:**
   - Execute the tests using `pytest` in the project root.
